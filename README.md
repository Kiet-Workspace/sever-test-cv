## Overview
  This is a one-page portfolio challenge I just finished. It takes me about 12 hours to complete it. Too much, right? I want to train myself by taking on more challenges with increasing difficulty.
### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Hook the form up so it sends and stores the user's enquiry (you can use a spreadsheet or Airtable to save the enquiries) - I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO THIS, I'LL LEARN ABOUT IT AND COMPLETE THIS SECTION SOON!
- **Bonus**: Add your own details (image, skills, projects) to replace the ones in the design

```html
<div class="email-warning-icon">
  <img src="./assets/images/warning-circle.svg" alt="">
</div> 
```
```css
.email-warning-icon img {
    filter: invert(17%) sepia(96%) saturate(6592%) hue-rotate(360deg) brightness(95%) contrast(117%);
}
```
